We would suggest that Andrew McCulloch be selected as the associate editor to manage this manuscript, for his knowledge of computational modeling of muscle. 

We would suggest the following reviewers: 
    * Henk Granzier, for his work with on muscle modeling
    * Kenneth B Campbell, for his work on muscle modeling
    * Angela Bagni, for her work on the effects of lattice spacing
    * Thomas Irving, for his work on the effects of lattice spacing
