Author Summary: 
Models of muscle contraction have long treated the molecular motor myosin as a simple spring oriented parallel to its direction of movement. 
This does not allow for the investigation of phenomena such as the perpendicular force observed during shortening, or the dependence of the maximum force produced on spacing between the contractile filaments that comprise muscle.
We demonstrate an alternative model, computationally simple enough to use in large networked models, that incorporate both linear and torsional or angular springs. These models capture much of the behavior missing from previous efforts.

\section*{Introduction} %(fold)

Sarcomere-scale modeling of muscle contraction has largely changed since the introduction of the sliding crossbridge model in the 1950s, but the geometry of the individual crossbridges used has remained largely unaltered. 
While thermodynamic account had been introduced to the crossbridge kinetics, compliance has been introduced to the filaments, and multiple filaments have been arranged to mimic the lattice, the one dimensional single spring nature of the crossbridge has continued to be used as a model of the mechanism of force generation.

\cite{Houdusse:2001:p182} and others have proposed that the region of the lever arm directly adjacent to the converter region is a flexible area that acts as a spring. This pliant region is the most likely candidate for the job of torsional spring.

\label{sub:historical_one_dimensional_crossbridge}

\marginpar{May be out of place now. Move to discussion or intro?}

The one dimensional crossbridge has remained the dominant model of the crossbridge since its introduction by \citet{Huxley1957e}. 
The structure of the one dimensional crossbridge has remained largely unchanged while the kinetics underlying transitions between force generating states have been increased in complexity throughout subsequent work. \citep{PateCooke1988, Daniel1998a,Chase2004a,Tanner2007a}
Figures describing the free energy and transition rates of the single spring crossbridge, which are suitable for comparison to Figures \ref{fig:4s} and \ref{fig:4s}, are available from \citet{Tanner2007a}.

The geometry of these one-dimensional models of the crossbridge have been devised with an eye towards accounting for the offset generated by the powerstroke and the energy utilized in the creation of this offset. 
From these two concerns the force the spring (assuming it to be a linear one) can produce is accounted for. 
In a two dimensional model there is the additional goal of replicating the crossbridge's sensitivity to lattice spacing and multidimensional force generated.

The two spring crossbridge uses one linear and one torsional spring to represent the myosin head, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:types}C.
This combination of springs introduces a dependence on crossbridge angle and a second dimension into the modeled crossbridge, distinguishing it from one spring predecessors.
This allows the reproduction of a type of lever based movement that closely analogous to that which is believed to occur in various types of myosin. \citet{Someone20xx, SomeoneElse19xx} 
This two-spring lever is differentiated from that which is thought to occur naturally by having its pivot point offset from the

\subsection{A 2-D 4-Spring Crossbridge} % (fold)
\label{sub:a_2_d_4_spring_crossbridge}

The four spring crossbridge uses two linear and two torsional springs to represent the myosin head, as depicted in Fig \ref{fig:types}, D. 
This allows the springs used in the model to closely correspond to pieces of the crossbridge. 
Specifically the four springs correspond to the S2 attachment region, the lever arm, the pliant region/converter domain, and the globular head region.
Values are chosen for the spring's rest lengths and angles that reflect what is known in literature, see table \ref{table:4s} for details.

\subsection{Kinetics of the two and four spring crossbridges} % (fold)
\label{sub:kinetics_of_the_two_and_four_spring_crossbridges}

As in other recent works, such as \citet{Tanner:2007:pe115}, we choose to use a simplified three state model of the crossbridge cycle with energies based on the work of Pate and Cooke in \citet{Pate1988}. 
This simplified system allows for the most direct linking of the crossbridge's kinetics and chemo-mechanics; the three kinetic states being directly comparable to the myosin configurations described in \citet{Houdusse:2000:p11238}.
A secondary benefit of a three state kinetics system is that it allows multiple-motor models which use our many-spring crossbridges to more easily compare their results to those from the aforementioned previous models.

The three states represented in our kinetics are an unbound state, a loosely-bound state, and a tightly-bound force-generating state.
As depicted in figure \ref{fig:types}A, these states correspond to a Myosin-ADP-Pi state, an Actin-Myosin-ADP-Pi state, and an Actin-Myosin-ADP state.

The kinetics of both the two spring and the four spring models are strain dependent and are essentially transforms of the free energy landscapes experienced by the crossbridges in their different states.
These free energies are a function of the distortion necessary to move the point representing the crossbridge's head to the point where we presume a binding site to be.
Examples of these free energy landscapes are visible in figures \ref{fig:2s}A and \ref{fig:4s}A, with cuts through them at multiple lattice spacings visible in figures \ref{fig:2s}B and \ref{fig:4s}B.

The binding of both the two and four spring crossbridges is determined by Monte-Carlo simulation of their diffusion as a result of being perturbed by Boltzmann derived energy distributions. 
After a new head location is found, a binding probability is calculated that decreases exponentially with distance from the potential binding site. 
This probability is tested against a random number from a uniform distribution to determine if binding occurs.



\begin{eqnarray}  
\label{eq:KineticRates}
	r_{12}(r, \theta)   & = & \frac{\sum_{b=1}^n (1\; \textrm{if}\; e^{-\textrm{distance}}>\textrm{rand} ,\; else\; 0)}{n}  \nonumber \\
    r_{23}(r, \theta)   & = & 0.001 + 0.5 * (1 + \tanh( \nonumber \\
                        &   & 0.6 (U_1(r, \theta) - U_2(r, \theta)))) \\
	r_{31}(r, \theta)   & = & e^{-1 / U_2(r, \theta)}
\end{eqnarray}

\section*{Results} % (fold)
\label{sec:results}

The obvious and intended consequence of the two and four spring crossbridges is the inclusion of a sensitivity to lattice spacing in the kinetics and force goerning and generted by the crossbridge head. 
In addition to scaling the probability of crossbridge interaction with an available binding site, altering the lacttice spacing in the two and four spring crossbridges also shifts the offsets of the binding sites that yield optimum probabilities of crossbridge interaction, effectively forward biasing the binding locations at larger lattice spacings.

        \textbf{Kinetic scheme and crossbridge types under investigation.} 
        The three state kinetic system used both here and in prior models is shown in subfigure a). The three states represented are an unbound state (1), a loosely bound state (2), and a strongly bound state (3). The binding rate ($r_{1,2}$), strong transition rate ($r_{2,3}$), and unbinding rate ($r_{3,1}$) at a given location are functions of the energy stored in the springs representing the crossbridge, if the crossbridge head is moved to that location. The reverse rates ($r_{2,1}$, $r_{3,2}$, and $r_{1,3}$) are all functions of the forward transition rates.
        Subfigures b), c), and d) show the various spring based representations of the crossbridge. Subfigure b) shows the single spring crossbridge representation used in models since \cite{Huxley1957e}. Subfigure c) shows the two spring system, consisting of a torsional/angular spring and a linear spring, that we propose to allow the modeling of radial forces. Finally, subfigure d) shows the four spring system using two torsional and two linear springs which we also compare to the single and dual spring crossbridges.

        The free energy of the two spring crossbridge at various lattice spacings (represented along the y-axis), with the head stretched to an axial offset from the point where it attaches to the thick filament (zero on the x-axis) is depicted in a). Colored horizontal lines through a) indicate the lattice spacings (36, 37, and 38 nm d$_{1,0}$) which are depicted as traces of free energy in b).
        The subfigures c) and d) show $r_{1,2}$, the probability that the two spring crossbridge will transition from an unbound state to a bound state, and the dependence of this transition on both the axial offset of the open binding site from the myosin thick filament attachment site and the lattice spacing $d_{1,0}$ which is a function of the distance between the binding site and the thick filament attachment point of the myosin head. Subfigure c) depicts this probabiity as a two dimensional contour with the same axes as a). Subfigure d) shows the probabilities of binding at the same series of lattice spacings as does b).
        Subfigures e) and f) show $r_{2,3}$, the probability of transition from a weakly bound state to a strongly bound state, with the same axes and scales as c) and d) show $r_{1,2}$.
        Subfigures g) and h) show $r_{3,1}$, the probability of unbinding from a strongly bound state, with the same axes and scales as c) and d) show $r_{1,2}$.
