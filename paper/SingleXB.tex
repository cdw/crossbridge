\marginpar{Currently, abstract gives main points of the paper.}
The 4 spring crossbridge (4sXB) is able to accurately model the movements believed to be behind the generation of force by myosin during the power stroke.
The 2 spring crossbridge (2sXB) shares many of the desirable properties of the 4sXB, such as the elimination of linear offsets in favor of experimentally measured changes in lever angle.
Both the 4sXB and the 2sXB maintain similar kinetics to previous work at resting lattice spacings, permitting more direct comparison of work done with either system to previous studies.
Unlike the 4sXB, the length and angle of the springs comprising the 2sXB can be analytically determined for any chosen head position without the use of iterative techniques.
Both the 4sXB and the 2sXB are able to measure the radial forces generated by during the production of axial force.
Similarly, both proposed crossbridge systems take lattice spacing into account in every aspect of their operation.
Lattice spacing dependent kinetics are derived based on the work of Pate and Cooke.
Lattice spacing dependent axial and radial forces are measured and considered.

\paragraph*{Author Summary} % (fold)
Models of muscle contraction have long treated the molecular motor myosin as a simple spring oriented parallel to its direction of movement. 
This does not allow for the investigation of phenomena such as the perpendicular force observed during shortening, or the dependence of the maximum force produced on spacing between the contractile filaments that comprise muscle.
We demonstrate an alternative model, computationally simple enough to use in large networked models, that incorporate both linear and torsional or angular springs. These models capture much of the behavior missing from previous efforts.

\section{Introduction} %(fold)

% * Set out view of force generation and power stroke
% * Mismatch with single spring crossbridge
%  - Considerations in modeling (computational complexity) 
% Needs more, come back to this

% Sarcomere-scale modeling of muscle contraction has changed since the introduction of the sliding crossbridge model in the 1950s, but the geometry of the individual crossbridges used has remained largely unaltered. 
% While individual crossbridges have been treated independently with spatial modeling, thermodynamic accounting has been introduced to the crossbridge kinetics, compliance introduced to the filaments, and multiple filaments have been arranged to mimic the lattice, the one dimensional nature of the crossbridge has continued to be used as a model of the mechanism of force generation.
% We propose that with a shift to crossbridges that use two or four four springs, new insight into the effects of lattice spacing and radial forces generated during axial shortening may be gained.

Theoretical and computational models of cross-bridge force generation have largely focused on one-dimensional analyses. 
Thus, from the early work of \citet{Huxley:1957:p255} to more recent models \citep{Daniel:1998:p1611, Chase:2004:p204, Tanner:2007:pe115} our focus has been more on the force distribution along the filament lattice.  
From a computational standpoint, somewhat less attention has focused on radial forces. 
That said the geometry of the single spring crossbridge has remained largely unchanged while the kinetics underlying transitions between force generating states have been increased in complexity throughout subsequent work. \citep{Pate:1989:p181, Daniel:1998:p1611, Tanner:2007:pe115}
Meanwhile, \citet{Houdusse:2001:p182} and others have proposed that the region of the lever arm directly adjacent to the converter region is a flexible area that acts as a spring. 
This model of force generation by myosin suggests that inclusion of torsional spring might create a system that better reflects the underling mechanisms of the powerstroke. 

Here we analyze the properties of and compare two torsional spring based crossbridge models that are targeted for use in spatially explicit models of the half sarcomere. 
The first is a four spring crossbridge (4sXB) that is directly inspired by the structure of the S1 and S2 regions of myosin II. 
Following this, we consider a two spring crossbridge (2sXB) that replicates many of the behaviors of the 4sXB while requiring fewer computational resources.

% % \paragraph{Comparison to previous systems} % (fold)
% This discussion owes a debt to \citet{Schoenberg:1980:p1802} and \citet{Schoenberg:1980:p1627} which contain a proposal and analysis of several different types of crossbridges, primarily two spring crossbridges where the S2 arm is represented as a linear spring and the S2-S1 junction area is represented as a torsional spring. 
% This system requires iterative solution methods, as our four spring crossbridge does, but restrains the crossbridge to an area within one S1 length of the line in which the S2 segment is set.

We consider two crossbridge models meant to capture a range of mechanical behaviors suggested by the literature.  
Each, described more fully below can be derived from a generalized crossbridge consisting of 4 springs:  two torsional springs and two linear springs (Fig \ref{fig:types}).  
These are contrasted to the traditional one-dimensional single spring model of a crossbridge.

\subsection*{Geometry} % (fold)

\paragraph{Spring configurations} % (fold)
Our simplest model consists of a single linear spring aligned parallel to the thick and thin filaments, existing in one dimension.
This one spring crossbridge (1sXB) is, as described above, the current crossbridge model implemented in most computational analyses. 
The one-dimensional 1sXB is insensitive to changes in lattice spacing, and unable to account for radial forces generated during axial shortening.

Our generalized four spring crossbridge (4sXB) uses two linear and two torsional springs to represent the myosin head, as depicted in Fig \ref{fig:types}D.
This allows the springs used in the model to closely correspond to pieces of the crossbridge.
Specifically the four springs correspond to the S2/rod attachment point, the S2 region, the S2/light chain domain (LCD) attachment point, and the LCD.
The use of multiple springs by the 4sXB also allow it to represent properties of the crossbridge that are only present in two dimensional space, in contrast to the one-dimensional 1sXB. 
The rest angle of the torsional spring linking the S2 domain and the LCD simulates the powerstroke by increasing during the transition from a weakly bound to a strongly bound state.
This two dimensionality allows the 4sXB to be embedded in a space that takes the distance between thick and thin filaments into account, introducing lattice spacing dependence.

The 2sXB uses one linear and one torsional spring to represent the myosin head, (Fig.~\ref{fig:types}C).
This crossbridge is a simplified version of the 4sXB, retaining movement generated by a lever arm, but altering the length of the lever such that it can bridge the entire distance between the thick and thin filaments.
The parameters characterizing the 2sXB are chosen to match the step size and kinetics of the 2sXB to those of the 4sXB.

Parameters for both crossbridges are derived, where possible, from existing physical measurements.
Each linear spring (one in the 1sXB, two in the 4sXB and one in the 2sXB) requires a rest length and spring constant, while each torsional spring (two in the 4sXB and one in the 2sXB) requires a rest angle and spring constant.
The lengths and angles of the springs used for the 4sXB are chosen from tomographic reconstructions of in vivo S2 lengths and x-ray crystallographic reconstructions of the S1 fragment \citep{Taylor:1999p2569, Rayment:1993p1914}.
The rest length and angle of the 2sXB are set so that the tips of the 2sXB and 4sXB are in the same location before and after the powerstroke.

 \item Define range of typical lattice spacings
 \item Show offset calculation from known $d_{10}$ of least radial force
 \item Should cite Millman in offset derivation also
\end{itemize}
% paragraph calculation_of_lattice_spacing (end)

\paragraph{Displacement and force generation} % (fold)
Based on earlier mechanical models of force generation (e.g.\ Pate and Cooke; Daniel et al; Tanner et al.) each crossbridge undergoes a distortion upon the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.Pi.  
That distortion changes the effective rest length of the crossbridge by an amount proportional to the energy derived from the hydrolysis.  
Within the 1sXB, this distortion is accomplished by a change in the rest length of the crossbridge's spring, while the 4sXB and 2sXB represent the distortion with a change in the rest angle of a torsional spring, a process more closely replicating the lever-arm mechanism \citep{Reedy:2000p2620}.
Upon release of Pi, distortional strain energy drives force generation by the crossbridge, essentially appearing as a change in the rest length of the molecule.
% paragraph displacement_and_force_generation (end)

\paragraph{Calculation of spring lengths and angles} % (fold)
% Goal here is to clearly communicate the ways in which the spring compoments are calculated. This should go through: what each angle actually is (from where to where with what as the apex), calculation of angle for 4sXB, and calculation of angle for the 2sXB.
When the 1sXB is placed under strain such that the myosin head is horizontally offset from the thick filament attachment site relative to its resting position, the length of the 1sXB's spring is simple to find as it must completely span the head to thick filament attachment distance.
The lengths and angles of the springs in the 2sXB and 4sXB must take into account the radial distance they must cover as well.
The 2sXB may be analytically determined, as it has all spring values set by the choice of a head location, with arm length and angle given by $r(h_x, h_y)=(h_x^2 + h_y^2)^{1/2}$ and $\theta(h_x, h_y)=\arctan(h_y/h_x)$, respectively.
The 4sXB's greater number of degrees of freedom mean it requires iterative optimization to find the location of the distal torsional spring representing the link between the S2 and S1 regions when the crossbridge's head is moved to a new location.
We use a modification of Powell's ``dog-leg'' method, present in the SciPy package of computational tools \citep{SciPy}, to relax the location of the distal torsional spring to that which results in the lowest energy state of the 4sXB.
Once the distal torsional spring's location is known (as $(c_x, c_y)$), the angle of the proximal torsional spring and the lengths of the two linear springs are determined analytically.
The angle of the proximal torsional spring is given as $\phi(c_x, c_y)=\arctan(c_y/c_x)$, the length of the proximal linear spring as $\ell(c_x, c_y)=(c_x^2 + c_y^2)^{1/2}$, the angle of the distal torsional spring as $\theta(c_x, c_y, h_x, h_y) = \arctan((h_y-c_y)/(h_x-c_x)) + \pi - \phi(c_x, c_y)$, and the length of the distal linear spring as $r(c_x, c_y, h_x, h_y)=((h_x-c_x)^2 + (h_y-c_y)^2)$.

We choose to use a simplified three state model of the crossbridge cycle \citep{Pate:1989:p181, Tanner:2007:pe115}. 
This simplified system directly links the crossbridge's kinetics to mechanics; the three kinetic states are directly comparable to the myosin configurations described in \citet{Houdusse:2000:p11238}.
A secondary benefit of a three state kinetics system is that it allows multiple-motor models which use our many-spring crossbridges to more easily compare their results to those from the aforementioned previous models.

The three states represented in our kinetics are (1) an unbound state (2) a loosely-bound state and (3) a tightly-bound force-generating state.
These states correspond to a Myosin-ADP-Pi state, an Actin-Myosin-ADP-Pi state, and an Actin-Myosin-ADP state (Fig. \ref{fig:types}A).

The kinetics of both the two spring and the four spring models are strain dependent and are essentially transforms of the free energy landscapes experienced by the crossbridges in their different states.
These free energies are a function of the distortion necessary to move the point representing the crossbridge's head to the point where we presume a binding site to be.
Examples of these free energy landscapes are visible in figures \ref{kinetics_contours}A and \ref{kinetics_contours}B, with cuts through them at the rest lattice spacing visible in figure \ref{kinetics_cuts}A.

The binding of both the two and four spring crossbridges is determined by Monte-Carlo simulation of their diffusion as a result of being perturbed by Boltzmann derived energy distributions. 
After a new head location is found, a binding probability is calculated that decreases exponentially with distance from the potential binding site. 
This probability is tested against a random number from a uniform distribution to determine if binding occurs.
This method is similar to that used by \citet{Tanner:2007:pe115}. 

\paragraph{Free energy in each state} % (fold)
The total energy, liberated by the hydrolysis of a $P_i$, available to a crossbridge depends on the concentrations of $ATP$, $ADP$ and $P_i$ and is given by $\Delta G = -\Delta G_{0,ATP} - \ln \frac{[ATP]}{[ADP] [P_i]}$. 
In weakly and strongly bound states a portion of that energy is available to the crossbridge, allowing the crossbridge at most 28\% (in the weakly bound state) or 68\% (in the strongly bound state) of $\Delta G$ for mechanical work (see efficiency factors $\alpha=0.28$ and $\eta=0.68$ below; \citet{Pate:1989:p181, Tanner:2007:pe115}).
The total free energy of a crossbridge in each state also depends on the strain that the crossbridge experiences from distortion upon binding.
Thus the total free energy is a linear combination of the strain-dependent and phosphate-dependent energy of the crossbridge in each state.
The free energy of the 4sXB system in each state is: 
%Energy of the four spring crossbridge
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{4sEnergy}
U_1(\phi,\ell,\theta,r) & = & 0 \nonumber \\
U_2(\phi,\ell,\theta,r) & = & \alpha \Delta G + \frac{k_\phi (\phi-\phi_0)^2 + k_\ell (\ell-\ell_0)^2 + k_\theta (\theta-\theta_0)^2 + k_r (r-r_0)^2}{2} \nonumber \\

\paragraph{Binding rate calculation} % (fold)
 % History and modern stuff
 % Binding depends on
 % Overview of steps
 %  - diffusion
 %  - attachment
Our binding algorithm is descended from \citet{Tanner:2007:pe115} but differs in two key ways: we treat binding as a two step process and our diffusion step works with any number of springs.
Binding depends on diffusion of the crossbridge head and proximity to the nearest binding site.
Analogously, the process we use to simulate binding has two components, first the diffusion of the myosin head to a new location and then possible attachment to the nearest binding site (depending on the distance from the head and the binding site).
The first step, diffusion, is simulated by thermally forcing each of a crossbridge's constituent springs with an energy plucked from a Boltzman distribution.
This translates to assigning each spring a length or angle chosen from the probability density function $P(x) = \sqrt{k / (2 \pi kT)} \exp^{-(k x^2)/(2 kT)}$ where $x$ is the offset, $k$ is the spring constant of the spring under consideration, and $T$ is the system's temperature in Kelvin.
We find the updated location of the crossbridge head from these new spring lengths and angles.
% Probability of binding based on distance to binding site
The probability the crossbridge will form an attachment depends on the exponential of $d$, the distance from the crossbridge head's new location to the nearest binding site.
Specifically, the probability of attachment is given by $p_{12}(d) = \gamma \exp ^{d}$, where $\gamma$ is a scaling factor chosen to provide attachment rates consistent with previous estimates.
Attachment occurs if $p_{12}$ is greater than $rand$, a number between 0 and 1 chosen from a uniform distribution.
This process is used to determine whether a crossbridge binds during a single timestep; binding rates are calculated as the fraction of an ensemble of crossbridges that bind given the same starting conditions. 
Thus, for an ensemble of size $n$: 
$$r_{12} =  \frac{\sum_0^n \left( 1\; \textrm{if}\; \gamma \exp^{-d}>rand ,\; \textrm{else}\; 0 \right)}{n}$$
This two step system, with diffusion followed by a chance of attachment, is used for both the 4sXB and 2sXB with only a change in the number of thermally forced springs.
% paragraph binding_rate_calculation (end)

\paragraph{Powerstroke and detachment rates} % (fold)
% Distortion dependence
The powerstroke and detachment rates are based on the earlier work of \citet{Pate:1989:p181} and \citet{Tanner:2007:pe115}, and generalized here for the 4sXB and 2sXB in two-dimensional space. 
Both the powerstroke rate, $r_{23}$, and the detachment rate, $r_{31}$, are distortion dependent as they contain a term based on the differences in free energy between the current state and the one being considered for transition. 
This means that transitions are more likely when they are energetically favorable and less likely in other circumstances, a natural scheme based in the geometry of the crossbridges.
The particular rates are as follows for both the 4sXB and the 2sXB:
$$r_{23}(U_2, U_3) = 0.001 + 0.5 * (1 + \tanh(0.6 (U_2 - U_3))) $$
$$r_{31}(U_3, U_1) = e^{-1 / (U_3 - U_1)}$$
% paragraph unbinding_rate (end)

\paragraph{Calculation of reverse rates} % (fold)
% Technique of reverse rate calculation
Reverse transition rates are given by the thermodynamically balancing formula $r_{ij}/r_{ji}=\exp^{U_i-U_j}$ where $r_{ji}$ is the forward rate and $r_{ij}$ is the reverse rate (see \citet{Pate:1989:p181, Daniel:1998:p1611, Tanner:2007:pe115}).
For the transition from a weakly bound state to an unbound state this requires that the reverse transition is again treated as a fraction of an ensemble of transition opportunities.

\section{Results} % (fold)

 % Results:
 %  * Axial shifts of XBs' properties (e.g. maxs, mins) are tuned with lattice spacing
 %  * Magnitudes vary with lattice spacing
 %   - With exception of powerstroke rates
 %   - Powerstroke rates compare two parabolic energy profiles
 %  * Kinetics at rest lattice spacings are similar to previous efforts
 %   - Results of models using such systems can be compared to prior work
 %  * Radial forces 
 %   - Are on same order as axial forces
 %   - Depends on lattice spacing
 %   - Depends on axial offset
 %  * Axial forces
 %   - Levels depend on axial offset
 %   - But not so dependent on lattice spacing

The models we present here were developed to examine consequences of lattice spacing on crossbridge kinetics and two dimensional force production.
Multi-spring crossbridges introduce lattice spacing dependence into force production and kinetics, and account for forces not aligned with the direction of contraction.
As lattice spacing changes, the kinetics and forces of the 4sXB and 2sXB shift in either or both magnitude and axial offset.

\subparagraph{Axial offsets, magnitudes, axial components and radial components} % (fold)
The axial offset of a crossbridge property is the distance from the thick filament attachment site to that property's extremum or point of inflection at a given lattice spacing. 
The scale of a crossbridge property is the value of that property's extremum at a given lattice spacing, should such an extremum exist.
The axial component of vector values, such as force, is the vector portion that lies along the axis of the thick and thin filaments.
The radial component of a vector value lies perpendicular to the thick and thin filaments, orthogonal to the axial component.
% subparagraph axial_offsets_magnitudes_axial_components_and_radial_components (end)

Baseline value changes occur where the lowest points, the highest points, or simply the offset of a value is shifted with regard to that seen at rest lattice spacing.
Baseline value changes manifest in, e.g., the lowered probability of any binding occurring at extreme lattice spacings. 
Key value offsets occur when maxima, minima, inflection points, or other landmarks of a value's profile are shifted axially from where they occur at rest lattice spacings.
Key value offsets are reflected in phenomena such as the axial offset at which a powerstroke will occur becoming right shifted at higher lattice spacings for the 2sXB.
In addition to these lattice spacing dependencies, we examine the ability of the 4sXB and the 2sXB to model the radial component of the force produced during the powerstroke.

\paragraph{At 34nm $d_{10}$, the multi- and single-spring crossbridges have similar kinetics and energies} % (fold)

The free energy, binding rates, powerstroke rates and detachment rates of the 4sXB and 2sXB at a lattice spacing of 34 nm $d_{10}$ are intentionally similar to those of the 1sXB (Figure \ref{kinetics_cuts}).

The kinetics and energies of the multi-spring crossbridges are derived from those of the single-spring crossbridge. 
The single-spring crossbridge kinetics and energies were modified to be independent of the number of springs in a crossbridge, instead depending on the energy stored as a result of distortion of the crossbridge head location.

The 1sXB values used here are calculated using the methods which produced Figure 10 in \citet{Tanner:2007:pe115}. 

This serves as a confirmation that the modifications which generalize the kinetics to two and higher dimensions do not strip away too many of the properties present in prior 1sXB models. 

Subfigure \ref{kinetics_cuts}b shows that using a thermally forced diffusion step in the calculation of attachment rates creates a very similar profile to that seen with non-physical methods.

The largest departure from previous kinetics occurs in the detachment rates, where the prior kinetics were least based on the energy of the crossbridge, and thus where the greatest departures were needed to produce a generalized system that functions for all spring-based crossbridges.

\paragraph{Key points of transition rates and energies vary with lattice spacing} % (fold)
For most crossbridge properties of the 4sXB and the 2sXB, the axial offset (the distance from the thick filament attachment point to peak probability of transition) varies with the inverse of lattice spacing.
% For both crossbridges modeled here, the axial offset and baselines that characterize their energy and transition rate curves vary with lattice spacing.
The changing axial offset of the energy and probability distributions is visible in Figure \ref{kinetics_contours} as a diagonal component to most of the shown contour lines. 
An example of this change in axial offset is visible in subfigures \ref{kinetics_contours}a and \ref{kinetics_contours}b where the lowest energy point that the 4sXB or the 2sXB may reach at a lattice spacing of 32 nm is more than three nm further from the crossbridge's thick filament attachment point than the lowest energy point reachable at a lattice spacing of 42 nm.
Similar phenomena can be seen in the binding rate and detachment rate contours shown in subfigures \ref{kinetics_contours}c, \ref{kinetics_contours}d, \ref{kinetics_contours}e, \ref{kinetics_contours}f, \ref{kinetics_contours}g, and \ref{kinetics_contours}h. 
The powerstroke rates shown in subfigures \ref{kinetics_contours}e and \ref{kinetics_contours}h also have a landmark point that depends on the lattice spacing, but are slightly different in that landmark is the inflection point of the transition probability rather than a maximum or minimum.
% paragraph key_points_of_transition_rates_and_energies_vary_with_lattice_spacing (end)


\paragraph{Magnitude of transition rates and energies vary with lattice spacing} % (fold)
All crossbridge properties that are derived from the free energy of the crossbridge (except for the powerstroke rate, see below) have 

Change in the baseline of the of the energy or transition rates as lattice spacing changes is separate from the altered axial offset of the rates and energies described above.
In all cases except that of the powerstroke rate we are dealing with profiles that are parabolic with lattice spacing as well as axial offset. 
This means e.g.\ that the probability of binding at the most favorable axial offset is still less at either extreme of lattice spacing than it will be at a rest lattice spacing. 
Likewise, any crossbridge that does manage to find its way to a force generating state will not remain in that state for long at the extremes of lattice spacing.
The powerstroke rates shown in subfigures \ref{kinetics_contours}e and \ref{kinetics_contours}h are again slightly different, and do not vary in magnitude with lattice spacing.
The powerstroke rates depends on the difference between two parabolic energy profiles, that of their respective crossbridges in the loosely bound state and in the strongly bound state. 
All other contours shown depend on only one parabolic component, the free energy of the unbound crossbridge being fixed at zero.
% paragraph magnitude_of_transition_rates_and_energies_vary_with_lattice_spacing (end)


\paragraph{Radial forces are on same order as axial forces, depend on lattice spacing and axial offset} % (fold)
The forces exerted by a 4sXB or 2sXB, when moved from its rest position to an axial offset, will have a radial component at all lattice spacings as shown in figure \ref{force_vectors}. 
Examining the force vectors in figure \ref{force_vectors}, produced by he compression or expansion caused when a crossbridge head is moved from its position of lowest energy, reveals that they are often off the horizontal by 45$^\circ$ or more. 
Such a deviation from purely horizontal, or axially aligned, force vectors indicates that the radial forces present are on the same order of magnitude as the axial forces. 
The size of these radial forces also appears to be more dependent on lattice spacing than that of the same crossbridge's axial forces. 
This increased dependence, due to changes in lattice spacing being changes in the radial direction, results in larger compressive force accompanying larger lattice spacings on a per crossbridge level. 
% paragraph radial_forces_are_on_same_order_as_axial_forces_dependent_on_lattice_spacing_and_axial_offset (end)

\paragraph{Axial force offset, but not magnitude, varies with lattice spacing} % (fold)
The axial force, which is the force directed in the direction of muscle shortening when mapped to an intact system, varies less with lattice spacing than does radial force, as shown in figure \ref{force_vectors}. 
Similar to the energy levels above in figure \ref{kinetics_contours}, the baseline of the axial force changes little over the various lattice spacings examined. 
However, the axial offset producing the least force in the axial direction at a given lattice spacing does shift by several nm over the examined lattice spacings. 
Thus increased or decreased axial force produced by a single modeled crossbridge at altered lattice spacings is due more to changes in resting position than overall elevated levels of strain in the crossbridge's constituent springs.

\paragraph{Strain and force generation at the level of a single crossbridge depend on lattice spacing} % (fold)
Lattice spacing greatly alters the kinetic landscape to which individual multi-spring crossbridges are subject.
Complex, and not entirely easy to visualize interactions occur between different kinetic rates with varying lattice spacing. 
A single example of this is that, for the 2sXB, the small lattice spacing axial offsets that are most likely to bind are increasingly less likely to quickly complete a powerstroke, due to the shift in the powerstroke rate's inflection point.
In addition to lattice spacing altering the interactions between kinetic rates, radial forces are found to be present at levels which often equal axial forces. 
Multiple spring crossbridges open new doors to explore the relationships between kinetics, lattice spacing, radial force and axial force.

\paragraph{Simplicity of the 2sXB may be desirable} % (fold)
While the 2sXB does not exactly mirror the behaviors of the 4sXB, it does resemble them in most ways (as seen in figures \ref{kinetics_contours}, \ref{kinetics_cuts} and \ref{force_vectors}) and may be the best option for further use in spatially explicit models due to its low computational requirements.
As mentioned in the methods section, whenever the head of the 4sXB is moved the position of the middle torsional spring, roughly equivalent to the convertor domain, must be found through an iterative technique. 
This imposes a computation cost that is small for a single crossbridge, but which make longer duration multifilament simulations untenable. 
These problems do not exist for the 2sXB which requires no such step.
As the kinetics and force of the 2sXB system resemble those of the 4sXB system in most instances, with the exceptions of their differing lattice spacing dependencies of the powerstroke rate and precise force orientation at some of the more extreme offsets, it may prove to be a useful model system.

\paragraph{Increased fidelity to known structure and mechanisms} % (fold)
The multiple spring crossbridges both have a far greater ability than single spring crossbridges to replicate the defining characteristics of muscle myosin structure and the lever arm mechanism of force generation. 
The 2sXB and the 4sXB both generate force through the changing of the rest angle of a torsional spring attached to a lever arm.
This is closely analogous to the lever arm mechanism as it is understood and stands in contrast to the mechanism by which a single spring crossbridge replicates the powerstroke \citep{Houdusse:2001:p182}.
The single spring crossbridge generates its force with an offset of the myosin head can also be thought of as the spring representing the crossbridge having a different rest length in the unbound state and the loosely bound state than it does in the tightly bound state. 
This offset or altered rest length is what determines the stroke distance of the single spring crossbridge and estimates of it have varied from as little as 1 nm to as large as 10 nm (needs citation). 
By treating the crossbridge as several components instead of a single spring we are able to base input parameters on values that can be referenced to existing crystallography structures.

\paragraph{Step size varies with lattice spacing for a two spring crossbridge} % (fold)
Inherent in the geometry of the 2sXB and the 4sXB is a change in step size with a change in lattice spacing.
Step size at a given lattice spacing is defined as the axial distance a myosin head moves between pre- and post-powerstroke angles if unconstrained in the axial direction and allowed to settle into the position which minimizes the energy of the crossbridge.
These changes in step size occur because the angle which a given axial movement subtends increases with decreasing lattice spacings.
This scenario also depends on the linear spring between the myosin's pivot point and the thin filament changing in length to accommodate differing lattice spacings.
The single linear spring of the 2sXB is the only means by which the 2sXB may span the distance from the single torsional spring to the thin filament and thus must change with lattice spacing.
However, the 4sXB is also possessed of the torsional and linear springs which are more proximal to the thick filament.
These additional springs also adjust with lattice spacing, allowing the location of the 4sXB's pivot point to alter so that the difference in step size with changes in lattice spacing is smaller, although still present.
This is yet another factor that may alter the force generated at different lattice spacings, increasing the strain and probability of detachment shortly after completing the powerstroke at larger lattice spacings.

\paragraph{Modeled radial forces are too large to ignore} % (fold)
Simulated radial forces for both the 2sXB and the 4sXB were of the same order as the axial forces being produced. 
Inclusion of these forces in future modeling efforts presents an opportunity to examine an type of interaction ignored by previous spatially explicit models.
Experimental evidence for the existence of strong radial forces during contraction is provided, at the level of muscle fibers, by observations of lattice spacings during redevelopment of tension in \citet{Cecchi:1990p2763}.
Spatially explicit explorations of how these forces are transmitted throughout the lattice, or what restoring force prevents the creation of an overly disordered lattice where radial forces kink thick and thin filaments out of their axial paths are possible with either presented crossbridge.

        \label{fig:types}
        \textbf{Kinetic scheme and crossbridge types under investigation.} 
        The three state kinetic system is shown in subfigure a. 
        The three states represent (1) an unbound state, (2) a loosely bound state, and (3) a strongly bound state. 
        The binding rate ($r_{1,2}$), strong transition rate ($r_{2,3}$), and unbinding rate ($r_{3,1}$) are determined by the energy stored in the springs representing the crossbridge. 
        The reverse rates ($r_{2,1}$, $r_{3,2}$, and $r_{1,3}$) are functions of the forward transition rates.
        Subfigures b, c, and d show the representations of the crossbridge we examine, plotted against a myosin crystal structure for comparison. 
        Subfigure b shows the single-spring crossbridge (1sXB) used heavily used in models since \protect\citep{Huxley:1957:p255}. 
        Subfigure c depicts the two-spring crossbridge (2sXB) which uses both a torsional/angular spring and a linear spring. 
        Subfigure d shows a four-spring crossbridge (4sXB) using two torsional and two linear springs, which we compare the single and dual spring crossbridges against.
        The locations of the distal torsional spring and tip of the 4sXB are denoted as $(c_x, c_y)$ and $(h_x, h_y)$ respectively. 
        The tip of the 2sXB is also denoted as $(c_x, c_y)$.

        \textbf{Energy and kinetics of the 4sXB and 2sXB systems at varying axial offsets and lattice spacings.} 
        Subfigures a through h show the properties of the 4sXB (subfigures a, c, e, and g) and the 2sXB (subfigures b, d, f, and h) as they change with binding site offset and $d_{1,0}$ lattice spacing.
        Binding site offset is the distance between the current axial location of the crossbridge's tip, $h_x$, and the location where the crossbridge attaches to the thick filament.
        Lattice spacing ($d_{1,-0}$) is defined as in \citet{Millman:1998p1346}, with an offset to account for filament thicknesses so that the crossbridge exactly bridges the two filaments at a rest lattice spacing of 34 nm.
        Subfigure a depicts the free energy of the 4sXB at various lattice spacings (represented along the y-axis), with the head stretched to an axial offset from the thick filament attachment point (zero on the x-axis).
        Similarly, the free energy of the 2sXB is shown in subfigure b.
        The lowest energy myosin head locations in both a and b are shown as the darkest part of the plot and change in axial offset as lattice spacing changes.
        The subfigures c and d show $r_{1,2}$, the probability that the 4sXB and the 2sXB will transition from an unbound state to a bound state, and the dependence of this transition on both the axial offset of the open binding site from the myosin thick filament attachment site and the lattice spacing $d_{1,0}$ which is a function of the distance between the binding site and the thick filament attachment point of the myosin head. 
        Subfigure c depicts this probability for the four spring crossbridge as a two dimensional contour with the same axes as a while subfigure d depicts the transition probabilities for the two spring crossbridge.
        Subfigures e and f show $r_{2,3}$, the probability of transition from a weakly bound state to a strongly bound state, for the same crossbridges, with the same axes and scales as c and d show $r_{1,2}$.
        Subfigures g and h show $r_{3,1}$, the probability of unbinding from a strongly bound state, for the same crossbridges, with the same axes and scales as c and d show $r_{1,2}$.
        The reverse rates, $r_{2,1}$, $r_{3,2}$, and $r_{1,3}$ may be back-calculated from the forward rates via the method described in \cite{Tanner:2007:pe115}.

        \textbf{Energy and kinetics of the 1sXB, 2sXB, and 4sXB at the resting lattice spacing.}
        Subfigures a through d show the energy and transition rates of the 1sXB (black line), 2sXB (green line), and 4sXB (red line) at resting lattice spacing.
        The 1sXB values shown for comparison are derived from those of \citet{Daniel:1998:p1611} and \citet{Tanner:2007:pe115}, shifted axially so the resting location of the crossbridge head in each case is aligned with that of the 2sXB and 4sXB. 
        The free energy of the crossbridges in state two is shown in subfigure a, where the multi-spring crossbridges' shifts from a strictly parabolic trajectory is visible.
        The explicit thermal forcing of the multi-spring crossbridge heads in subfigure b results in binding probabilities that are more distributed than those of the single spring crossbridge.
        The rate of powerstrokes, in subfigure c, remains least changed between the single and the multi-spring crossbridge models.
        The energy-based kinetics of the multi-spring crossbridges are least able to replicate the detachment rated of the 1sXB, as shown in subfigure d.

        \textbf{Overview and detail of the forces exerted by the 2sXB and 4sXB.}
        Subfigures a through d show the forces exerted by the 4sXB and the 2sXB, with the shade of the vector arrows being determined by the chance of such a configuration occurring, the $r_{23}$ transition probability. 
        Subfigures a and b show overviews of the forces exerted, respectively, by the 4sXB and the 2sXB over lattice spacings and axial offsets that vary as in Figure 2.
        The forces exerted by the two crossbridges have radial components which frequently equal or exceed their axial components.
        A more detailed view of the region surrounding the rest position of the crossbridges is shown in subfigures c and d, where the large radial components of the crossbridge forces, particularly for the 2sXB, is again evident.
