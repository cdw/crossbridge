title = {Myosin motors: missing structures and hidden springs},
abstract = {High-resolution structures of the motor domain of myosin II and lower resolution actin-myosin structures have led to the "swinging lever arm" model for myosin force generation. The available kinetic data are not all easily reconciled with this model and understanding the final details of the myosin motor mechanism must await actin-myosin co-crystals. The observation that myosin can populate multiple states in the absence of actin has nonetheless led to significant insights. The currently known myosin structures correspond to defined kinetic states that bind weakly (K(d)>microM) to actin. It is possible that the myosin lever arm could complete its swing before strong binding to actin and force generation--a process that would correspond, in the absence of load, to a Brownian ratchet. We further suggest that, under load, internal springs within the myosin head could decouple force generation and lever arm movement.},

annote = {Summary:
Folks still on fence about some kinetics corresponding to chemo-mechanical changes as of 2001. Pliant region likely a spring. Big angle differences between mysoins from various species.

Notes:

- Converter region and other pivot or switch regions are typically on the periphery of the molecule and have fewer attachments, making them more reconfigurable. 
- Pliant region is a little more towards the C terminal (and thick filamement) then the converter. Could be the region that bends/is sort of the torsional spring of the system.
- Lots of debate about the linking of kinetic steps to chemo-mechanical steps. Folks didn't just aggree that this transition is equivilent to this change in conformation right away.
- Some studies support the idea that Pi is released prior to the transition to a force generating state. This is one of the things that we lump together (in the r23 transition in this case).

title = {Three conformational states of scallop myosin S1},
abstract = {We have determined the structure of the intact scallop myosin head, containing both the motor domain and the lever arm, in the nucleotide-free state and in the presence of MgADP.V04, corresponding to the transition state. These two new structures, together with the previously determined structure of scallop S1 complexed with MgADP (which we interpret as a detached ATP state), reveal three conformations of an intact S1 obtained from a single isoform. These studies, together with new crystallization results, show how the conformation of the motor depends on the nucleotide content of the active site. The resolution of the two new structures ( approximately 4 A) is sufficient to establish the relative positions of the subdomains and the overall conformation of the joints within the motor domain as well as the position of the lever arm. Comparison of available crystal structures from different myosin isoforms and truncated constructs in either the nucleotide-free or transition states indicates that the major features within the motor domain are relatively invariant in both these states. In contrast, the position of the lever arm varies significantly between different isoforms. These results indicate that the heavy-chain helix is pliant at the junction between the converter and the lever arm and that factors other than the precise position of the converter can influence the position of the lever arm. It is possible that this pliant junction in the myosin head contributes to the compliance known to be present in the crossbridge.},

title = {Sarcomere lattice geometry influences cooperative myosin binding in muscle},
abstract = {In muscle, force emerges from myosin binding with actin (forming a cross-bridge). This actomyosin binding depends upon myofilament geometry, kinetics of thin-filament Ca(2+) activation, and kinetics of cross-bridge cycling. Binding occurs within a compliant network of protein filaments where there is mechanical coupling between myosins along the thick-filament backbone and between actin monomers along the thin filament. Such mechanical coupling precludes using ordinary differential equation models when examining the effects of lattice geometry, kinetics, or compliance on force production. This study uses two stochastically driven, spatially explicit models to predict levels of cross-bridge binding, force, thin-filament Ca(2+) activation, and ATP utilization. One model incorporates the 2-to-1 ratio of thin to thick filaments of vertebrate striated muscle (multi-filament model), while the other comprises only one thick and one thin filament (two-filament model). Simulations comparing these models show that the multi-filament predictions of force, fractional cross-bridge binding, and cross-bridge turnover are more consistent with published experimental values. Furthermore, the values predicted by the multi-filament model are greater than those values predicted by the two-filament model. These increases are larger than the relative increase of potential inter-filament interactions in the multi-filament model versus the two-filament model. This amplification of coordinated cross-bridge binding and cycling indicates a mechanism of cooperativity that depends on sarcomere lattice geometry, specifically the ratio and arrangement of myofilaments.},

abstract = {The filament lattice of striated muscle is an overlapping hexagonal array of thick and thin filaments within which muscle contraction takes place. Its structure can be studied by electron microscopy or X-ray diffraction. With the latter technique, structural changes can be monitored during contraction and other physiological conditions. The lattice of intact muscle fibers can change size through osmotic swelling or shrinking or by changing the sarcomere length of the muscle. Similarly, muscle fibers that have been chemically or mechanically skinned can be compressed with bathing solutions containing very large inert polymeric molecules. The effects of lattice change on muscle contraction in vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscle and in invertebrate striated muscle are reviewed. The force developed, the speed of shortening, and stiffness are compared with structural changes occurring within the lattice. Radial forces between the filaments in the lattice, which can include electrostatic, Van der Waals, entropic, structural, and cross bridge, are assessed for their contributions to lattice stability and to the contraction process.},

title = {Visualizing myosin's power stroke in muscle contraction},
abstract = {The long-standing swinging crossbridge or lever arm hypothesis for the motor action of myosin heads finds support in recent results from 3-D tomograms of insect flight muscle (IFM) fast frozen during active contraction and from both fluorescence polarization and X-ray diffraction during rapid stretches or releases of isometrically contracting fibers. The latter provide direct evidence for lever arm movements synchronous with force changes. Rebuilding the atomic model of nucleotide-free subfragment 1 (S1) to fit fast-frozen, active IFM crossbridges suggests a two-stage power stroke in which the catalytic domain rolls on actin from weak to strong binding; this is followed by a 5-nm lever arm swing of the light chain domain, which gives a total interaction distance of approx. 12 nm. Comparison of S1 crystal structures with in situ myosin heads suggests that actin binding may be necessary in order to view the full repertoire of myosin motor action. The differing positions of the catalytic domains of actin-attached myosin heads in contracting IFM suggest that both the actin-myosin binding energy and the hydrolysis of ATP may be used to cock the crossbridge and drive the power stroke.},

title = {A model of crossbridge action: the effects of ATP, ADP and Pi},
abstract = {We have explored a model of crossbridge kinetics that explains many of the effects on steady-state muscle contraction of ligands that bind to the nucleotide site on myosin. The mathematical model follows the basic framework for crossbridge function first established by A. F. Huxley. In the model, detached crossbridges initially bind in a weakly attached, A.M.D.Pi state (A, actin; M, myosin; D, ADP; Pi, orthophosphate) at the beginning of the region of positive force production. Pi release then results in transition to a strongly-bound A.M.D state, as has been suggested by other investigators from both biochemical and mechanical data. Mg2+ ADP release and subsequent crossbridge detachment due to Mg2+ ATP binding to the A.M state occur at the end of the region of positive force production. Work in a number of laboratories has now defined the effects on steady-state contraction of variations in the concentrations of Mg2+ ATP, Mg2+ ADP and Pi. These data provide valuable constraints that can be used to further refine current models. The maximum velocity of shortening (V max) and ATPase activity of muscle fibres exhibit classical saturation behaviour with respect to Mg2+ ATP concentration, with Mg2+ ADP acting as a competitive inhibitor. The model can reproduce this behaviour. The model also explains the observations that increasing [Mg2+ ATP] decreases isometric tension and increasing [Mg2+ ADP] increases tension. As the concentration of Pi increases, model predictions suggest that tension should decrease approximately as log[Pi], that ATPase activity should decrease less than tension and that V max should be almost unchanged, as has been found experimentally. The model also demonstrates that the connection between the parameters of contraction and the free energy of hydrolysis of Mg2+ ATP can be complex.},

abstract = {Time-resolved lattice spacing changes were measured (10-millisecond time resolution) by x-ray diffraction of synchrotron radiation in single intact muscle fibers of the frog Rana temporaria undergoing electrically stimulated tension development during application of stretches and releases. Ramp releases, which decreased fiber length at constant speed, caused a lattice expansion. After the ramp, increasing tension during recovery was accompanied by lattice compression. Ramp stretches caused a compression of the lattice. While the fiber was held at a constant length after the stretch, tension decreased and lattice spacing increased. These observations demonstrate the existence of a previously undetected radial component of the force generated by a cycling crossbridge. At sarcomere lengths of 2.05 to 2.2 micrometers, the radial force compresses the myofilament lattice. Hence, the myofilament lattice does not maintain a constant volume during changes in force.},

abstract = {The subfragment 2/light meromyosin "hinge" region has been proposed to significantly contribute to muscle contraction force and/or speed. Transgenic replacement of the endogenous fast muscle isovariant hinge A (exon 15a) in Drosophila melanogaster indirect flight muscle with the slow muscle hinge B (exon 15b) allows examination of the structural and functional changes when only this region of the myosin molecule is different. Hinge B was previously shown to increase myosin rod length, increase A-band and sarcomere length, and decrease flight performance compared to hinge A. We applied additional measures to these transgenic lines to further evaluate the consequences of modifying this hinge region. Structurally, the longer A-band and sarcomere lengths found in the hinge B myofibrils appear to be due to the longitudinal addition of myosin heads. Functionally, hinge B, although a significant distance from the myosin catalytic domain, alters myosin kinetics in a manner consistent with this region increasing myosin rod length. These structural and functional changes combine to decrease whole fly wing-beat frequency and flight performance. Our results indicate that this hinge region plays an important role in determining myosin kinetics and in regulating thick and thin filament lengths as well as sarcomere length.},

Investigating S2/LMM linkage/hinge

S1: 
	globular head
S2: 
	area between myosin head and rod
LMM: 
	C-terminal regon of myosin rod

Claim two hinges: S1/S2 hinge and the S2/LMM hinge with following functions
	S1/S2 hinge orients myosin head toward the thin filament
	S2/LMM hinge allows the myosin head to move away from the thick filament

So this brings up a possible objection to the lattice spacing dependence of my xxCG model: it could be that it is just producing a LS dependence by not allowing the myosin head to swing out from the thick filament properly. A response to this is that there will still be an alteration of the pulling compression component of the vector with changes in lattice spacing, at least I think so. This would be a good thing to look into... maybe with something like a 2->3 transition vector field with parallel offset as the x axis and lattice spacing as the y axis.

title = {Coupling between phosphate release and force generation in muscle actomyosin},
abstract = {Energetic, kinetic and oxygen exchange experiments in the mid-1980s and early 1990s suggested that phosphate (Pi) release from actomyosin-adenosine diphosphate Pi (AM.ADP.Pi) in muscle fibres is linked to force generation and that Pi release is reversible. The transition leading to the force-generating state and subsequent Pi release were hypothesized to be separate, but closely linked steps. Pi shortens single force-generating actomyosin interactions in an isometric optical clamp only if the conditions enable them to last 20-40 ms, enough time for Pi to dissociate. Until 2003, the available crystal forms of myosin suggested a rigid coupling between movement of switch II and tilting of the lever arm to generate force, but they did not explain the reciprocal affinity myosin has for actin and nucleotides. Newer crystal forms and other structural data suggest that closing of the actin-binding cleft opens switch I (presumably decreasing nucleotide affinity). These data are all consistent with the order of events suggested before: myosin.ADP.Pi binds weakly, then strongly to actin, generating force. Then Pi dissociates, possibly further increasing force or sliding.},

title = {A spatially explicit nanomechanical model of the half-sarcomere: myofilament compliance affects Ca(2+)-activation},
abstract = {The force exerted by skeletal muscle is modulated by compliance of tissues to which it is connected. Force of the muscle sarcomere is modulated by compliance of the myofilaments. We tested the hypothesis that myofilament compliance influences Ca2+ regulation of muscle by constructing a computational model of the muscle half sarcomere that includes compliance of the filaments as a variable. The biomechanical model consists of three half-filaments of myosin and 13 thin filaments. Initial spacing of motor domains of myosin on thick filaments and myosin-binding sites on thin filaments was taken to be that measured experimentally in unstrained filaments. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to determine transitions around a three-state cycle for each cross-bridge and between two-states for each thin filament regulatory unit. This multifilament model exhibited less "tuning" of maximum force than an earlier two-filament model. Significantly, both the apparent Ca(2+)-sensitivity and cooperativity of activation of steady-state isometric force were modulated by myofilament compliance. Activation-dependence of the kinetics of tension development was also modulated by filament compliance. Tuning in the full myofilament lattice appears to be more significant at submaximal levels of thin filament activation.},
