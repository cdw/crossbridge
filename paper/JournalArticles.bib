title = {Three conformational states of scallop myosin S1},
abstract = {We have determined the structure of the intact scallop myosin head, containing both the motor domain and the lever arm, in the nucleotide-free state and in the presence of MgADP.V04, corresponding to the transition state. These two new structures, together with the previously determined structure of scallop S1 complexed with MgADP (which we interpret as a detached ATP state), reveal three conformations of an intact S1 obtained from a single isoform. These studies, together with new crystallization results, show how the conformation of the motor depends on the nucleotide content of the active site. The resolution of the two new structures ( approximately 4 A) is sufficient to establish the relative positions of the subdomains and the overall conformation of the joints within the motor domain as well as the position of the lever arm. Comparison of available crystal structures from different myosin isoforms and truncated constructs in either the nucleotide-free or transition states indicates that the major features within the motor domain are relatively invariant in both these states. In contrast, the position of the lever arm varies significantly between different isoforms. These results indicate that the heavy-chain helix is pliant at the junction between the converter and the lever arm and that factors other than the precise position of the converter can influence the position of the lever arm. It is possible that this pliant junction in the myosin head contributes to the compliance known to be present in the crossbridge.},

title = {Coupling between phosphate release and force generation in muscle actomyosin},
abstract = {Energetic, kinetic and oxygen exchange experiments in the mid-1980s and early 1990s suggested that phosphate (Pi) release from actomyosin-adenosine diphosphate Pi (AM.ADP.Pi) in muscle fibres is linked to force generation and that Pi release is reversible. The transition leading to the force-generating state and subsequent Pi release were hypothesized to be separate, but closely linked steps. Pi shortens single force-generating actomyosin interactions in an isometric optical clamp only if the conditions enable them to last 20-40 ms, enough time for Pi to dissociate. Until 2003, the available crystal forms of myosin suggested a rigid coupling between movement of switch II and tilting of the lever arm to generate force, but they did not explain the reciprocal affinity myosin has for actin and nucleotides. Newer crystal forms and other structural data suggest that closing of the actin-binding cleft opens switch I (presumably decreasing nucleotide affinity). These data are all consistent with the order of events suggested before: myosin.ADP.Pi binds weakly, then strongly to actin, generating force. Then Pi dissociates, possibly further increasing force or sliding.},

title = {Crystal structure of scallop Myosin s1 in the pre-power stroke state to 2.6 a resolution: flexibility and function in the head},
abstract = {We have extended the X-ray structure determination of the complete scallop myosin head in the pre-power stroke state to 2.6 A resolution, allowing an atomic comparison of the three major (weak actin binding) states of various myosins. We can now account for conformational differences observed in crystal structures in the so-called "pliant region" at the motor domain-lever arm junction between scallop and vertebrate smooth muscle myosins. A hinge, which may contribute to the compliance of the myosin crossbridge, has also been identified for the first time within the regulatory light-chain domain of the lever arm. Analysis of temperature factors of key joints of the motor domain, especially the SH1 helix, provides crystallographic evidence for the existence of the "internally uncoupled" state in diverse isoforms. The agreement between structural and solution studies reinforces the view that the unwinding of the SH1 helix is a part of the cross-bridge cycle in many myosins.},

title = {Alternative S2 hinge regions of the myosin rod affect myofibrillar structure and myosin kinetics},
abstract = {The subfragment 2/light meromyosin "hinge" region has been proposed to significantly contribute to muscle contraction force and/or speed. Transgenic replacement of the endogenous fast muscle isovariant hinge A (exon 15a) in Drosophila melanogaster indirect flight muscle with the slow muscle hinge B (exon 15b) allows examination of the structural and functional changes when only this region of the myosin molecule is different. Hinge B was previously shown to increase myosin rod length, increase A-band and sarcomere length, and decrease flight performance compared to hinge A. We applied additional measures to these transgenic lines to further evaluate the consequences of modifying this hinge region. Structurally, the longer A-band and sarcomere lengths found in the hinge B myofibrils appear to be due to the longitudinal addition of myosin heads. Functionally, hinge B, although a significant distance from the myosin catalytic domain, alters myosin kinetics in a manner consistent with this region increasing myosin rod length. These structural and functional changes combine to decrease whole fly wing-beat frequency and flight performance. Our results indicate that this hinge region plays an important role in determining myosin kinetics and in regulating thick and thin filament lengths as well as sarcomere length.},

Investigating S2/LMM linkage/hinge

S1: 
	globular head
S2: 
	area between myosin head and rod
LMM: 
	C-terminal regon of myosin rod

Claim two hinges: S1/S2 hinge and the S2/LMM hinge with following functions
	S1/S2 hinge orients myosin head toward the thin filament
	S2/LMM hinge allows the myosin head to move away from the thick filament

So this brings up a possible objection to the lattice spacing dependence of my xxCG model: it could be that it is just producing a LS dependence by not allowing the myosin head to swing out from the thick filament properly. A response to this is that there will still be an alteration of the pulling compression component of the vector with changes in lattice spacing, at least I think so. This would be a good thing to look into... maybe with something like a 2->3 transition vector field with parallel offset as the x axis and lattice spacing as the y axis.

title = {The neck region of the myosin motor domain acts as a lever arm to generate movement},
abstract = {The myosin head consists of a globular catalytic domain that binds actin and hydrolyzes ATP and a neck domain that consists of essential and regulatory light chains bound to a long alpha-helical portion of the heavy chain. The swinging neck-level model assumes that a swinging motion of the neck relative to the catalytic domain is the origin of movement. This model predicts that the step size, and consequently the sliding velocity, are linearly related to the length of the neck. We have tested this point by characterizing a series of mutant Dictyostelium myosins that have different neck lengths. The 2xELCBS mutant has an extra binding site for essential light chain. The delta RLCBS mutant myosin has an internal deletion that removes the regulatory light chain binding site. The delta BLCBS mutant lacks both light chain binding sites. Wild-type myosin and these mutant myosins were subjected to the sliding filament in vitro motility assay. As expected, mutants with shorter necks move slower than wild-type myosin in vitro. Most significantly, a mutant with a longer neck moves faster than the wild type, and the sliding velocities of these myosins are linearly related to the neck length, as predicted by the swinging neck-lever model. A simple extrapolation to zero speed predicts that the fulcrum point is in the vicinity of the SH1-SH2 region in the catalytic domain.},

title = {A model of crossbridge action: the effects of ATP, ADP and Pi},
abstract = {We have explored a model of crossbridge kinetics that explains many of the effects on steady-state muscle contraction of ligands that bind to the nucleotide site on myosin. The mathematical model follows the basic framework for crossbridge function first established by A. F. Huxley. In the model, detached crossbridges initially bind in a weakly attached, A.M.D.Pi state (A, actin; M, myosin; D, ADP; Pi, orthophosphate) at the beginning of the region of positive force production. Pi release then results in transition to a strongly-bound A.M.D state, as has been suggested by other investigators from both biochemical and mechanical data. Mg2+ ADP release and subsequent crossbridge detachment due to Mg2+ ATP binding to the A.M state occur at the end of the region of positive force production. Work in a number of laboratories has now defined the effects on steady-state contraction of variations in the concentrations of Mg2+ ATP, Mg2+ ADP and Pi. These data provide valuable constraints that can be used to further refine current models. The maximum velocity of shortening (V max) and ATPase activity of muscle fibres exhibit classical saturation behaviour with respect to Mg2+ ATP concentration, with Mg2+ ADP acting as a competitive inhibitor. The model can reproduce this behaviour. The model also explains the observations that increasing [Mg2+ ATP] decreases isometric tension and increasing [Mg2+ ADP] increases tension. As the concentration of Pi increases, model predictions suggest that tension should decrease approximately as log[Pi], that ATPase activity should decrease less than tension and that V max should be almost unchanged, as has been found experimentally. The model also demonstrates that the connection between the parameters of contraction and the free energy of hydrolysis of Mg2+ ATP can be complex.},

title = {Response of equatorial x-ray reflections and stiffness to altered sarcomere length and myofilament lattice spacing in relaxed skinned cardiac muscle},
abstract = {Low angle x-ray diffraction measurements of myofilament lattice spacing (D(1,0)) and equatorial reflection intensity ratio (I(1,1)/I(1,0)) were made in relaxed skinned cardiac trabeculae from rats. We tested the hypothesis that the degree of weak cross-bridge (Xbr) binding, which has been shown to be obligatory for force generation in skeletal muscle, is modulated by changes in lattice spacing in skinned cardiac muscle. Altered weak Xbr binding was detected both by changes in I(1,1)/I(1,0) and by measurements of chord stiffness (chord K). Both measurements showed that, similar to skeletal muscle, the probability of weak Xbr binding at 170-mM ionic strength was significantly enhanced by lowering temperature to 5 degrees C. The effects of lattice spacing on weak Xbr binding were therefore determined under these conditions. Changes in D(1,0), I(1,1)/I(1,0), and chord K by osmotic compression with dextran T500 were determined at sarcomere lengths (SL) of 2.0 and 2.35 micro m. At each SL increasing [dextran] caused D(1,0) to decrease and both I(1,1)/I(1,0) and chord K to increase, indicating increased weak Xbr binding. The results suggest that in intact cardiac muscle increasing SL and decreasing lattice spacing could lead to increased force by increasing the probability of initial weak Xbr binding.},

title = {Sarcomere lattice geometry influences cooperative myosin binding in muscle},
abstract = {In muscle, force emerges from myosin binding with actin (forming a cross-bridge). This actomyosin binding depends upon myofilament geometry, kinetics of thin-filament Ca(2+) activation, and kinetics of cross-bridge cycling. Binding occurs within a compliant network of protein filaments where there is mechanical coupling between myosins along the thick-filament backbone and between actin monomers along the thin filament. Such mechanical coupling precludes using ordinary differential equation models when examining the effects of lattice geometry, kinetics, or compliance on force production. This study uses two stochastically driven, spatially explicit models to predict levels of cross-bridge binding, force, thin-filament Ca(2+) activation, and ATP utilization. One model incorporates the 2-to-1 ratio of thin to thick filaments of vertebrate striated muscle (multi-filament model), while the other comprises only one thick and one thin filament (two-filament model). Simulations comparing these models show that the multi-filament predictions of force, fractional cross-bridge binding, and cross-bridge turnover are more consistent with published experimental values. Furthermore, the values predicted by the multi-filament model are greater than those values predicted by the two-filament model. These increases are larger than the relative increase of potential inter-filament interactions in the multi-filament model versus the two-filament model. This amplification of coordinated cross-bridge binding and cycling indicates a mechanism of cooperativity that depends on sarcomere lattice geometry, specifically the ratio and arrangement of myofilaments.},

title = {Coiled-coil unwinding at the smooth muscle myosin head-rod junction is required for optimal mechanical performance},
abstract = {Myosin II has two heads that are joined together by an alpha-helical coiled-coil rod, which can separate in the region adjacent to the head-rod junction (Trybus, K. M. 1994. J. Biol. Chem. 269:20819-20822). To test whether this flexibility at the head-rod junction is important for the mechanical performance of myosin, we used the optical trap to measure the unitary displacements of heavy meromyosin constructs in which a stable coiled-coil sequence derived from the leucine zipper was introduced into the myosin rod. The zipper was positioned either immediately after the heads (0-hep zip) or following 15 heptads of native sequence (15-hep zip). The unitary displacement (d) decreased from d = 9.7 +/- 0.6 nm for wild-type heavy meromyosin (WT HMM) to d = 0.1 +/- 0.3 nm for the 0-hep zip construct (mean +/- SE). Native values were restored in the 15-hep zip construct (d = 7.5 +/- 0.7 nm). We conclude that flexibility at the myosin head-rod junction, which is provided by an unstable coiled-coil region, is essential for optimal mechanical performance.},

title = {The filament lattice of striated muscle},
abstract = {The filament lattice of striated muscle is an overlapping hexagonal array of thick and thin filaments within which muscle contraction takes place. Its structure can be studied by electron microscopy or X-ray diffraction. With the latter technique, structural changes can be monitored during contraction and other physiological conditions. The lattice of intact muscle fibers can change size through osmotic swelling or shrinking or by changing the sarcomere length of the muscle. Similarly, muscle fibers that have been chemically or mechanically skinned can be compressed with bathing solutions containing very large inert polymeric molecules. The effects of lattice change on muscle contraction in vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscle and in invertebrate striated muscle are reviewed. The force developed, the speed of shortening, and stiffness are compared with structural changes occurring within the lattice. Radial forces between the filaments in the lattice, which can include electrostatic, Van der Waals, entropic, structural, and cross bridge, are assessed for their contributions to lattice stability and to the contraction process.},

abstract = {The force exerted by skeletal muscle is modulated by compliance of tissues to which it is connected. Force of the muscle sarcomere is modulated by compliance of the myofilaments. We tested the hypothesis that myofilament compliance influences Ca2+ regulation of muscle by constructing a computational model of the muscle half sarcomere that includes compliance of the filaments as a variable. The biomechanical model consists of three half-filaments of myosin and 13 thin filaments. Initial spacing of motor domains of myosin on thick filaments and myosin-binding sites on thin filaments was taken to be that measured experimentally in unstrained filaments. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to determine transitions around a three-state cycle for each cross-bridge and between two-states for each thin filament regulatory unit. This multifilament model exhibited less "tuning" of maximum force than an earlier two-filament model. Significantly, both the apparent Ca(2+)-sensitivity and cooperativity of activation of steady-state isometric force were modulated by myofilament compliance. Activation-dependence of the kinetics of tension development was also modulated by filament compliance. Tuning in the full myofilament lattice appears to be more significant at submaximal levels of thin filament activation.},

title = {Detection of radial crossbridge force by lattice spacing changes in intact single muscle fibers},
abstract = {Time-resolved lattice spacing changes were measured (10-millisecond time resolution) by x-ray diffraction of synchrotron radiation in single intact muscle fibers of the frog Rana temporaria undergoing electrically stimulated tension development during application of stretches and releases. Ramp releases, which decreased fiber length at constant speed, caused a lattice expansion. After the ramp, increasing tension during recovery was accompanied by lattice compression. Ramp stretches caused a compression of the lattice. While the fiber was held at a constant length after the stretch, tension decreased and lattice spacing increased. These observations demonstrate the existence of a previously undetected radial component of the force generated by a cycling crossbridge. At sarcomere lengths of 2.05 to 2.2 micrometers, the radial force compresses the myofilament lattice. Hence, the myofilament lattice does not maintain a constant volume during changes in force.},

title = {Titin-based modulation of calcium sensitivity of active tension in mouse skinned cardiac myocytes},
abstract = {We studied the effect of titin-based passive force on the length dependence of activation of cardiac myocytes to explore whether titin may play a role in the generation of systolic force. Force-pCa relations were measured at sarcomere lengths (SLs) of 2.0 and 2.3 microm. Passive tension at 2.3 microm SL was varied from approximately 1 to approximately 10 mN/mm(2) by adjusting the characteristics of the stretch imposed on the passive cell before activation. Relative to 2.0 microm SL, the force-pCa curve at 2.3 microm SL and low passive tension showed a leftward shift (pCa(50) [change in pCa at half-maximal activation]) of 0.09+/-0.02 pCa units while at 2.3 microm SL and high passive tension the shift was increased to 0.25+/-0.03 pCa units. Passive tension also increased pCa(50) at reduced interfilament lattice spacing achieved with dextran. We tested whether titin-based passive tension influences the interfilament lattice spacing by measuring the width of the myocyte and by using small-angle x-ray diffraction of mouse left ventricular wall muscle. Cell width and interfilament lattice spacing varied inversely with passive tension, in the presence and absence of dextran. The passive tension effect on length-dependent activation may therefore result from a radial titin-based force that modulates the interfilament lattice spacing.},

title = {Length-dependent Ca(2+) activation in cardiac muscle: some remaining questions},
abstract = {The steep relationship between systolic force and end diastolic volume in cardiac muscle (Frank-Starling relation) is, to a large extent, based on length-dependent changes in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. How sarcomere length modulates Ca(2+) sensitivity is still a topic of active investigation. Two general themes have emerged in recent years. On the one hand, there is a large body of evidence indicating that length-dependent changes in lattice spacing determine changes in Ca(2+) sensitivity for a given set of conditions. A model has been put forward in which the number of strong-binding cross-bridges that are formed is directly related to the proximity of the myosin heads to binding sites on actin. On the other hand, there is also a body of evidence suggesting that lattice spacing and Ca(2+) sensitivity are not tightly linked and that there is a length-sensing element in the sarcomere, which can modulate actin-myosin interactions independent of changes in lattice spacing. In this review, we examine the evidence that has been cited in support of these viewpoints. Much recent progress has been based on the combination of mechanical measurements with X-ray diffraction analysis of lattice spacing and cross-bridge interaction with actin. Compelling evidence indicates that the relationship between sarcomere length and lattice spacing is influenced by the elastic properties of titin and that changes in lattice spacing directly modulate cross-bridge interactions with thin filaments. However, there is also evidence that the precise relationship between Ca(2+) sensitivity and lattice spacing can be altered by changes in protein isoform expression, protein phosphorylation, modifiers of cross-bridge kinetics, and changes in titin compliance. Hence although there is no unique relationship between Ca(2+) sensitivity and lattice spacing the evidence strongly suggests that under any given set of physiological circumstances variation in lattice spacing is the major determinant of length-dependent changes in Ca(2+) sensitivity.},

title = {Mechanics and models of the myosin motor},
abstract = {In striated muscles, shortening comes about by the sliding movement of thick filaments, composed mostly of myosin, relative to thin filaments, composed mostly of actin. This is brought about by cyclic action of 'cross-bridges' composed of the heads of myosin molecules projecting from a thick filament, which attach to an adjacent thin filament, exert force for a limited time and detach, and then repeat this cycle further along the filament. The requisite energy is provided by the hydrolysis of a molecule of adenosine triphosphate to the diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, the steps of this reaction being coupled to mechanical events within the cross-bridge. The nature of these events is discussed. There is good evidence that one of them is a change in the angle of tilt of a 'lever arm' relative to the 'catalytic domain' of the myosin head which binds to the actin filament. It is suggested here that this event is superposed on a slower, temperature-sensitive change in the orientation of the catalytic domain on the actin filament. Many uncertainties remain. },

title = {Interactions between connected half-sarcomeres produce emergent mechanical behavior in a mathematical model of muscle},
abstract = {Most reductionist theories of muscle attribute a fiber's mechanical properties to the scaled behavior of a single half-sarcomere. Mathematical models of this type can explain many of the known mechanical properties of muscle but have to incorporate a passive mechanical component that becomes approximately 300% stiffer in activating conditions to reproduce the force response elicited by stretching a fast mammalian muscle fiber. The available experimental data suggests that titin filaments, which are the mostly likely source of the passive component, become at most approximately 30% stiffer in saturating Ca2+ solutions. The work described in this manuscript used computer modeling to test an alternative systems theory that attributes the stretch response of a mammalian fiber to the composite behavior of a collection of half-sarcomeres. The principal finding was that the stretch response of a chemically permeabilized rabbit psoas fiber could be reproduced with a framework consisting of 300 half-sarcomeres arranged in 6 parallel myofibrils without requiring titin filaments to stiffen in activating solutions. Ablation of inter-myofibrillar links in the computer simulations lowered isometric force values and lowered energy absorption during a stretch. This computed behavior mimics effects previously observed in experiments using muscles from desmin-deficient mice in which the connections between Z-disks in adjacent myofibrils are presumably compromised. The current simulations suggest that muscle fibers exhibit emergent properties that reflect interactions between half-sarcomeres and are not properties of a single half-sarcomere in isolation. It is therefore likely that full quantitative understanding of a fiber's mechanical properties requires detailed analysis of a complete fiber system and cannot be achieved by focusing solely on the properties of a single half-sarcomere.},

The latter provide direct evidence for lever arm movements synchronous with force changes. Rebuilding the atomic model of nucleotide-free subfragment 1 (S1) to fit fast-frozen, active IFM crossbridges suggests a two-stage power stroke in which the catalytic domain rolls on actin from weak to strong binding; this is followed by a 5-nm lever arm swing of the light chain domain, which gives a total interaction distance of approx. 12 nm. Comparison of S1 crystal structures with in situ myosin heads suggests that actin binding may be necessary in order to view the full repertoire of myosin motor action. The differing positions of the catalytic domains of actin-attached myosin heads in contracting IFM suggest that both the actin-myosin binding energy and the hydrolysis of ATP may be used to cock the crossbridge and drive the power stroke.},

title = {Myosin motors: missing structures and hidden springs},
abstract = {High-resolution structures of the motor domain of myosin II and lower resolution actin-myosin structures have led to the "swinging lever arm" model for myosin force generation. The available kinetic data are not all easily reconciled with this model and understanding the final details of the myosin motor mechanism must await actin-myosin co-crystals. The observation that myosin can populate multiple states in the absence of actin has nonetheless led to significant insights. The currently known myosin structures correspond to defined kinetic states that bind weakly (K(d)>microM) to actin. It is possible that the myosin lever arm could complete its swing before strong binding to actin and force generation--a process that would correspond, in the absence of load, to a Brownian ratchet. We further suggest that, under load, internal springs within the myosin head could decouple force generation and lever arm movement.},

annote = {Summary:
Folks still on fence about some kinetics corresponding to chemo-mechanical changes as of 2001. Pliant region likely a spring. Big angle differences between mysoins from various species.

Notes:

- Converter region and other pivot or switch regions are typically on the periphery of the molecule and have fewer attachments, making them more reconfigurable. 
- Pliant region is a little more towards the C terminal (and thick filamement) then the converter. Could be the region that bends/is sort of the torsional spring of the system.
- Lots of debate about the linking of kinetic steps to chemo-mechanical steps. Folks didn't just aggree that this transition is equivilent to this change in conformation right away.
- Some studies support the idea that Pi is released prior to the transition to a force generating state. This is one of the things that we lump together (in the r23 transition in this case).

- Discussion of springs in myosin on pg 189, check out "Is the lever arm of myosin a molecular elastic element?,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1996, 93:4462", also pliant point spring is mentioned in Houdusse et al 2000

title = {Characterization of radial force and radial stiffness in Ca(2+)-activated skinned fibres of the rabbit psoas muscle},
abstract = {1. When chemically skinned muscle fibres are activated by Ca2+ at an ionic strength of 170 mM, the spacing between the filaments has been shown to decrease with increasing force, suggesting that the cross-bridges can generate force not only in the axial but also in the radial direction. In the present study, radial force and radial stiffness of activated single skinned rabbit psoas fibres were studied by X-ray diffraction. The responses of the lattice spacing to changes in osmotic pressure by application of dextran T500, which is equivalent to force applied in the radial direction, was examined. The radial force generated by the attached cross-bridges was calculated, with the approximation that a negligible fraction of cross-bridges was attached in the relaxed muscle at the same ionic strength of 170 mM. 2. The active radial force was found to be a slightly non-linear function of lattice spacing, reaching zero at 34 nm. The radial force was compressive at lattice spacing greater than 34 nm and expansive at less than 34 nm. 3. The active axial force, on the other hand, was found to be much less affected by the application of dextran T500. Active axial force increased by 4% to a plateau at 4% dextran T500 and then decreased by 10% at 8% dextran T500. 4. While not under osmotic pressure, the radial force of the activated fibre was determined to be 400 pN (single thick filament)-1. This is of the same order of magnitude as the axial force. The radial stiffness was also comparable to the axial stiffness at 7 pN (thick filament)-1 (0.1 nm)-1. 5. The radial elasticity of the fully activated fibre differs significantly from that of the fibre in rigor. The radial stiffness exhibited by fibres in rigor was approximately five times higher, at 30 pN (thick filament)-1 (0.1 nm)-1 and the point where the radial force reached zero was 38 nm. 6. In the activated state, the point at which radial force reaches zero is independent of the level of Ca2+ activation, i.e. independent of the number of cross-bridges attached to actin in the force-generating state. We suggest that the zero-force point is equivalent to the equilibrium point of a spring and is an intrinsic property of the radial elasticity of the cross-bridge. 7. It is concluded that activated and rigor cross-bridges exhibit a spring-like property in the radial direction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

* Radial forces expansive at LS<34nm d10, zero at LS=34nm d10 and compressive at LS>34nm d10
* Radial force is on the same order of magnitude as axial force
* Rigor fibers have their zero radial force point at 38nm d10
