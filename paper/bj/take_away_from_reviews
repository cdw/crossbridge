# Thoughts about and ways to address BJ reviewer comments

## Reviewer 1

Totally valid requests for clarification that need to be gone through piece-by-piece.

## Reviewer 2

Address the similarities to the Schoenberg work more throughly.
Run some sample cases of force generation and walk the reader through them (maybe a figure of what the radial force produced by an isomerization at a given lattice spacing and attachment location is, we can predict the pre/post-power-stroke forces at all axial and radial offsets).

## Reviewer 3

Super specific comments with references that I need to read. This is actually helpful but a little worrisome as I am not sure that all the complaints about the structure of the cross-bridge model used will be easy to address.
