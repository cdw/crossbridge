\opening{Dear Edward H. Egelman,}

Please find attached our manuscript entitled, \emph{Lattice spacing and multi-dimensional force in the cross-bridge}. 
To our knowledge, this is the first analytical treatment of a cross-bridge as a combination of torsional and axial springs capable of investigating the role of lattice spacing in force generation. 
This new model of the cross-bridge works via the lever-arm mechanism; consequentially, it displays novel sensitives to lattice spacing and radial forces near those predicted by experiment. 
We found that changes in lattice spacing affected the cross-bridge's step size, as well as the axial and radial forces the cross-bridge generates.

We would suggest the following reviewers: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kenneth B Campbell, for his work on muscle modeling
    \item Thomas Irving, for his work on the effects of lattice spacing changes
    \item Dave W Maughan, for his work on the effects of lattice spacing changes
    \item H Lee Sweeney, for his work with molecular motors 
\end{itemize}
