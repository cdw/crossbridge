 Author Summary: Models of muscle contraction have long treated the molecular motor myosin as a simple spring oriented parallel to its direction of movement. This does not allow for the investigation of phenomena such as the perpendicular force observed during shortening, or the dependence of the maximum force produced on spacing between the contractile filaments that comprise muscle. We demonstrate an alternative model, computationally simple enough to use in large networked models, that incorporate both linear and torsional or angular springs. These models capture much of the behavior missing from pervious efforts.}}} \\

\section*{Introduction}

Sarcomere-scale modeling of muscle contraction has largely changed since the introduction of the sliding crossbridge model in the 1950s, but the geometry of the individual crossbridges used has remained largely unaltered. While thermodynamic account had been introduced to the crossbridge kinetics, compliance has been introduced to the filaments, and multiple filaments have been arranged to mimic the lattice, the one dimensional single spring nature of the crossbridge has continued to be used as a model of the mechanism of force generation.
