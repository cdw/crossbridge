@article{Daniel1998a,
	Abstract = {The presence of compliance in the lattice of filaments in muscle raises a number of concerns about how one accounts for force generation in the context of the cross-bridge cycle--binding site motions and coupling between cross-bridges confound more traditional analyses. To explore these issues, we developed a spatially explicit, mechanochemical model of skeletal muscle contraction. With a simple three-state model of the cross-bridge cycle, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to compute the instantaneous balance of forces throughout the filament lattice, accounting for both thin and thick filament distortions in response to cross-bridge forces. This approach is compared to more traditional mass action kinetic models (in the form of coupled partial differential equations) that assume filament inextensibility. We also monitored instantaneous force generation, ATP utilization, and the dynamics of the cross-bridge cycle in simulations of step changes in length and variations in shortening velocity. Three critical results emerge from our analyses: 1) there is a significant realignment of actin-binding sites in response to cross-bridge forces, 2) this realignment recruits additional cross-bridge binding, and 3) we predict mechanical behaviors that are consistent with experimental results for velocity and length transients. Binding site realignment depends on the relative compliance of the filament lattice and cross-bridges, and within the measured range of these parameters, gives rise to a sharply tuned peak for force generation. Such mechanical tuning at the molecular level is the result of mechanical coupling between individual cross-bridges, mediated by thick filament deformations, and the resultant realignment of binding sites on the thin filament.},

@article{Chase2004a,
	Abstract = {The force exerted by skeletal muscle is modulated by compliance of tissues to which it is connected. Force of the muscle sarcomere is modulated by compliance of the myofilaments. We tested the hypothesis that myofilament compliance influences Ca2+ regulation of muscle by constructing a computational model of the muscle half sarcomere that includes compliance of the filaments as a variable. The biomechanical model consists of three half-filaments of myosin and 13 thin filaments. Initial spacing of motor domains of myosin on thick filaments and myosin-binding sites on thin filaments was taken to be that measured experimentally in unstrained filaments. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to determine transitions around a three-state cycle for each cross-bridge and between two-states for each thin filament regulatory unit. This multifilament model exhibited less "tuning" of maximum force than an earlier two-filament model. Significantly, both the apparent Ca(2+)-sensitivity and cooperativity of activation of steady-state isometric force were modulated by myofilament compliance. Activation-dependence of the kinetics of tension development was also modulated by filament compliance. Tuning in the full myofilament lattice appears to be more significant at submaximal levels of thin filament activation.},

@article{Tanner2007a,
	Abstract = {In muscle, force emerges from myosin binding with actin (forming a cross-bridge). This actomyosin binding depends upon myofilament geometry, kinetics of thin-filament Ca(2+) activation, and kinetics of cross-bridge cycling. Binding occurs within a compliant network of protein filaments where there is mechanical coupling between myosins along the thick-filament backbone and between actin monomers along the thin filament. Such mechanical coupling precludes using ordinary differential equation models when examining the effects of lattice geometry, kinetics, or compliance on force production. This study uses two stochastically driven, spatially explicit models to predict levels of cross-bridge binding, force, thin-filament Ca(2+) activation, and ATP utilization. One model incorporates the 2-to-1 ratio of thin to thick filaments of vertebrate striated muscle (multi-filament model), while the other comprises only one thick and one thin filament (two-filament model). Simulations comparing these models show that the multi-filament predictions of force, fractional cross-bridge binding, and cross-bridge turnover are more consistent with published experimental values. Furthermore, the values predicted by the multi-filament model are greater than those values predicted by the two-filament model. These increases are larger than the relative increase of potential inter-filament interactions in the multi-filament model versus the two-filament model. This amplification of coordinated cross-bridge binding and cycling indicates a mechanism of cooperativity that depends on sarcomere lattice geometry, specifically the ratio and arrangement of myofilaments.},
