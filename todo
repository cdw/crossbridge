## Near Term
 - Design a figure that explores the changes in force and kinetics as a given parameter, e.g. S2 length, is changed. The purpose of this is to snag some ammo to use against worries that the model is overly dependent on parameter choice. On second thought, it might be best to limit the properties explored to force, obviating the need for the multiple long runs that it would take to put together the binding rate figure for multiple parameter values.
 - Mike wants the 'energy bean' back, possibly by modifying Fig 2
### Tom Comments 
 - Make a symbol table for referencing, or at least for an appendix.

## Long Term
 - Read http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jrs/jrspapers.html is conj grad method better?
