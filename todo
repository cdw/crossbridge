## Near Term
 - Mike wants the 'energy bean' back, possibly by modifying Fig 2
 - Do a lit search of BiophysJ and see if it is not possible to get a table of acronyms and their definitions near the start.
 - Come up with a term to replace spatially explicit, one that conveys the idea that it is a multiple spring cross-bridge that is sensitive to radial force and lattice spacing, but that it is just one cross-bridge not a chain.
 - Look up Lu and other radial force papers for citation. 
    - Write summary of each and the methods used therein.

## Long Term
 - Read http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jrs/jrspapers.html is conj grad method better?
