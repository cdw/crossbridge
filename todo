## Near Term
 - Mike wants the 'energy bean' back, possibly by modifying Fig 2
 - Need to get a parameter table to improve the methods section
    - This is turning into a lit-cite thing, with much data already in the ParameterGeneration.py file.
 - Color in Fig 4
 - Try to cut off Figure 4 with the energy that it takes to get a crossbridge to a given location, rather than by transition probabilities.


## Long Term
 - Read http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jrs/jrspapers.html is conj grad method better?
